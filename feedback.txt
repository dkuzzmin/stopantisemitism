Dima: Antisemitism posts analyser
Amazing project! Super related to your course.
As a NLP student, I particulary love your project! Your decision of using Textblob is precise, 
because other libraries such as nltk are more complex and could take you more time to finish the project.
OOP was precisly implemented, as well as database manipulations and relantionships.
For OOP I would advice you to use some decorators to enrich the project.
I just wish you could use some API and JSON.
An idea to implement them would be to use a API to scrap real posts in instagram and analyse them.
